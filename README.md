## Overview

_About 15% of the PeopleInsights workforce leaves each year. Company management have noticed a recurring theme of delayed projects and unkept deadlines among former employees, resulting in the need for a sizeable recruiting department and many resources allocated to new training.
As an HR analyst, they have contacted me to understand certain KPIs and what potential changes they should make to the workplace to better retain employees.

## Task

As an HR analyst, they have contacted me to understand various factors that could be correlated to the high attrition rate and to see what potential changes they could make to the workplace to better retain employees.

Questions that PeopleInsights would like answered are:

1. What is the average Environment Satisfaction score across different departments?

2. How does Work-Life Balance correlate with Job Satisfaction in the Employee Survey Data?

3. What is the distribution of employees based on their Distance from Home?

4. How many employees have been classified as high performers (Performance Rating) in each department?

5. What is the trend in Employee Count by Department over time?

6. What percentage of employees travel for business versus those who do not?

7. How does Attrition rate vary by Age group and Department?

8. What is the average Job Involvement score among employees who have left the company versus those who remain?

9. How many employees fall into each Education Level category?

10. What are the average salaries based on Job Roles, and how do they compare to Employee Satisfaction levels?


## About the Data

The dataset includes six tables, capturing general employee data, employe survey data, manager survey data, and clocking in and out times, with nearly 22,100 rows and over 550 columns.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL)

I started organizing the five main data tables by loading each into Power BI's Power Query Editor.



The first step in transforming the data was make sure the row headers are correct. When I loaded the data into Power Query, the column headers were pushed down into Row 2. Using the Use First Row as Headers tool in the Transform tab, I easily fixed this.
