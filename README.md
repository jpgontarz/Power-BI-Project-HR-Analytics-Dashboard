## Task

In this analysis, I help the HR department with the following:

1. What is the average tenure for employees within each department?

2. How many employees in each department are still working at the company?

3. How does job satisfaction for employees compare with different tenure levels?

4. What percentage of employees who work overtime have left the company?

5. Rank departments by average manager ratings, separated by business travel.

6. Is there a positive correlation between the number of training opportunities an employee has taken and their job satisfaction?

7. Identify the top three employees by their manager rating in each department.

8. Categorize employees based on their distance from work and show average job satisfaction in each category.

9. Is there a relationship between the number of promotions and the years an employee has spent with their current manager?

10. For each department, identify the percentage of employees who have left the company and had a job satisfaction score below 3.
